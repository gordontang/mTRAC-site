During the ideation phase, the team created one use case from the three provided by the client. From this use case, we developed a set of features that would be required to perform all the use case's actions or tasks.

The team divided the feature set into two components: hardware and software. This enabled us to brainstorm potential implementations of the feature set separately. With hardware, we were able to come up with 3 to 10 potential implementations of each feature (e.g. a video camera could be a GoPro, webcam, camera on the Surface Pro or laptop). On the other hand, we found that the potential software implementations were highly constrained and there were few alternatives. Ultimately, there would only be one software implementation we could use.

After ideating for the software and hardware feature sets, we will be assessing and selecting the best design alternative.
