The team developed 5 design alternatives over the past week and came together to select the best design. We used a [weighted decision matrix](http://deseng.ryerson.ca/dokuwiki/design:weighted_decision_matrix) to identify the top alternatives.	Each team member (5 of us) ranked each alternative based on the design criteria our client validated (objectives and constraints).

We then collectively weighted each criteria and calculated the scores we gave each alternative. With these scores, each team member had 1-2 top alternatives selected and we discussed why each solution ranked highly and would be suitable for the project. For example, using the Oculus Rift to create a virtual classroom would be highly portable and could work for certain use cases.

Once the top scoring alternatives were discussed, the team used an average of our alternatives' scores to identify a winner. For us, it was straightforward as the average score was significantly higher for the best alternative.

Moving forward, we will be developing a more detailed design for the selected alternative.
